# Introduction to group coding exercises
You will form groups of four and work on this exercise together, submitting a single code at the end of the class period. You will work together on exercises in the same groups each Thursday this quarter. Introduce yourselves and and decide among yourselves which roles you would like to undertake. Note that you cannot have the same role two weeks in a row, and you must fill each role at least once during the quarter.

## Roles and Responsibilities:

1. Developer: Person who types the code and submits it to Canvas at the end of the class period.

2. Reporter: Responsible for communicating with instructors, writing exercise reflection, and keeping any written notes.

3. Researcher: Search slides, notes, and internet for solutions to coding problems.

4. Documenter: Make sure code is adequately commented. Make sure any code solutions used from an online source like Stack Overflow are clearly noted and cited to avoid plagiarism.

**In-class coding exercise #1** <br>
Objective: This exercise introduces you to writing Python code in Google Colab notebooks and builds familiarity with variables and math operations, debugging code, and manipulating strings.

Instructions:

- Assign group roles and note in the Canvas submission text box which who filled which roles.
- The group developer will get code from the Class_Files folder on the Google Drive, then open in in Google Colab.
- Complete the assignment together by writing and executing text and code cells as specified. For this assignment, do not use any features of Python that have not yet been discussed in the lessons or class sessions.
- Discuss the reflection questions at the end of the exercise. The group reporter will type concise answers to each in the provided text box.
- When you're finished and are ready to submit the exercise, the group developer will upload the completed notebook it to Canvas. No submission is necessary from other group members.
